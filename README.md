    * Click "Authentication" in the left-hand menu
    * Click the "sign-in method" tab
    * Click "anonymous" and enable it
    * Create an app within your Firebase instance for Android, with package name com.yourcompany.cleantodo
    * Follow instructions to download google-services.json, and place it into clean_todo/android/app/
    * Run the following command to get your SHA-1 key:
    
       ```
       keytool -exportcert -list -v -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore
